AUID: rrp0019
Hours Spent: 20.5
Consulted With: Consulted with Tyler Ray (tpr0010) and Joel Gush (jag0102)
Resources Used: Did not use any outside resources dealing with the code itself. Only with setting up the environment.
Impressions: The code for the project is not bad but the specifications were atrocious and the TAs seemed to lack knowledge on clarifying the specifications which seems to be as a result of the professor
    not knowing exact specifications.
